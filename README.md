# uniris_lib_dart

Uniris dart library for Flutter based on [Official Uniris Javascript library for Node and Browser](https://github.com/UNIRIS/uniris-libjs)

## Usage

This library aims to provide a easy way to create Uniris transaction and to send them over the network.

It supports the Uniris Cryptography rules which are:

- Algorithm identification: the first byte of key and hashes identify the curve or the digest algorithm used to help determine which algorithm during
  verification.

- Key derivation:
  
    To be able to retrieve previous public key, the Uniris network designs the key derivation through a seed (passphrase) and an index(number of
     previous public keys/transactions).
    The procedure is described as follows:
    
    ```
    The seed generates a master key and an entropy used in the child keys generation.

                                                               / (256 bytes) Next private key
                          (256 bytes) Master key  --> HMAC-512
                        /                              Key: Master entropy,
      seed --> HMAC-512                                Data: Master key + index)
                        \
                         (256 bytes) Master entropy

    ```
